# Power-Ball
A baseball game that uses academics instead of athletes. You are a regular joe, love baseball and electronics, or gardening, or being a automotive tech. The common thread here is baseball. So you join up, create your character. You decide to be a pitcher, no, a short stop. First base? Whatever. Pick your team. You know IT. Now you can play with friends! Get the whole gang involved. Play against other nations! This is baseball, but, if your at bat, your swing or success of hitting the ball, depends on your knowledge in the field of your team. Choose the question difficulty, answer it. Depending on the dificulty, if you needed help from your team, and if you got it correct, will all factor into if you get that home run, base hit, or knocked hit, and benched. If your a pitcher, you'd best be good. There are no easy questions, questions correspond to pitch types, the manager will not wait long to bring in relief, and the fans can throw a mean hotdog.

Batting order is arranged by answered questions. Tie will be broken with the average of correctly answered questions. Batters can ask for an assist from any team member on base, if the question is above an easy. Honestly, I would recommend any question above easy. The best easy will get you is a bunt to the pitcher, or a sweet slope to second base, not to mention, to many will have management looking to set you back to training camp.

## Planning

Baseball rules apply. So teams with batter against pitcher for runs.
