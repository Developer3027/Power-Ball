# Power-Ball
A baseball game that uses academics instead of athletes. You are a regular joe, love baseball and electronics, or gardening, or being a automotive tech. The common thread here is baseball. So you join up, create your character. You decide to be a pitcher, no, a short stop. First base? Whatever. Pick your team. You know IT. Now you can play with friends! Get the whole gang involved. Play against other nations! This is baseball, but, if your at bat, your swing or success of hitting the ball, depends on your knowledge in the field of your team. Choose the question difficulty, answer it. Depending on the dificulty, if you needed help from your team, and if you got it correct, will all factor into if you get that home run, base hit, or knocked hit, and benched. If your a pitcher, you'd best be good. There are no easy questions, questions correspond to pitch types, the manager will not wait long to bring in relief, and the fans can throw a mean hotdog.

#### Game Play
Batter up! Your turn at bat. Choose your difficulty. Answer the question. If there is a player on base, and you choose a difficulty over easy, then you can ask the players on base for an assist. You answer the question correctly. It was medium difficulty with no assist.

Now, let's look at the pitcher. The pitcher chooses a difficulty.

The playbook wants the ball placed to right field because the average is low. Because your average is higher than the playbook, and because you got the answer correct, the game only determines if it will be a base hit or a home run. 


Batting order is arranged by answered questions. Tie will be broken with the average of correctly answered questions. Batters can ask for an assist from any team member on base, if the question is above an easy. Honestly, I would recommend any question above easy. The best easy will get you is a bunt to the pitcher, or a sweet slope to second base, not to mention, to many will have management looking to set you back to training camp.



## Planning

Baseball rules apply. So teams with batter against pitcher for runs.
##### Manager
The manager will handle the team. They put up the money for the teams. If you are organized enough, you will want shirts, caps, training, and prize potential. I will not list all the things a manager can do, hoestly it depends on the individual teams as to how they are set up. I will lay out what a manager can not do. A manager can not just be a figure head. Once a team has a Head coach (1), a scout (1), and a full roaster (min 10), the team is considered stable. At this point you will sign an agreement. If the agreement is breached then pay a fine. The manager is to ensure great teams thrive and survive. A team can transfer ownership only after informing the coaches and scouts. A team can be disbanded only with an signed agreement from all current team members.

##### Head Coach
The coach of the team is the professer. They will create the questions. They will assist in designing the different playbooks. They can also scout talent, but no one can be added to or removed from the roaster unless both the manager and the head coach sign off on it. 

##### Batter Coach
The batter coach assists the head coach with designing questions. Batter coach will also run the batter play book. The play book is run after the question has been answered correctly by the player. Plays are generated randomly. The higher the difficulty, the less random the generator.

##### Scout
A scout can spectate games looking for talent. A scout has access to the player meta data like how many easy question compared to how many hard questions. Scouts do not have access to the questions themselves.
